# Flappy

The idea is to create the basics for flappy games such as flappy bird, flappy camel, flappy flappy ... using a pure Javascript and canvas
I created this project locally last year, but I stopped working on it, I push it now to github looking forward to find a great developers want to contribute on this small project, welling to make it useful to others for further learning or developpment.
Please feel free to change and improve.
