# Flappy

The idea is to create the basics for flappy games such as flappy bird, flappy flappy ... using just Javascript and canvas
I created this project last year just for fun, but I stopped working on it, I push it now to github and looking forward to see it grow, welling to make it useful to others for further learning or developpment.
Feel free to change and improve.
